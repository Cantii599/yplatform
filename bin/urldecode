  # This is perhaps a risky gambit, but since all escape characters must be
  # encoded, we can replace %NN with \xNN and pass the lot to printf -b, which
  # will decode hex for us

  printf -v REPLY '%b' "${1//%/\\x}" # You can either set a return variable (FASTER)

  echo "${REPLY}"  #+or echo the result (EASIER)... or both... :p
