# Bootstrap

## `git clone` support-firecloud

**NOTE** All documentation here refers to `~/git/firecloud/support-firecloud` as the home of support-firecloud.
You can chose any folder you like, but then you'll have to pay attention every time you might copy-paste
some instruction from our documentation. If you still want to use another folder, you could consider at least
symlinking `~/git/firecloud/support-firecloud` to the folder of your choice, so copy-pasting would still work.


```shell
cd # make sure that you are at home dir (~)
git clone git://github.com/rokmoln/support-firecloud.git ~/git/firecloud/support-firecloud
```
