# git (and Github)

## Feature branches

We use a convention of prefixing feature branches with `f/`.
The term `feature` is overloaded, as it means any topic e.g. `bug`, `emergency-fix`, `user`, etc.

This allows different systems, like the CI/CD, to make certain decisions based on the name of the branch.

One sensible thing to do further is to have your branches start with a unique indicative,
like your username e.g.

* GOOD `f/anu-add-logo` (`anu` is my username)
* GOOD `f/add-logo`
* DONT `add-logo`
